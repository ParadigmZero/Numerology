Enter a series of letters and/or numbers.

Any letters are converted into numbers by the following two methods:

Pythagorean ("Agrippan") method

1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9
A    B    C    D    E    F    G    H    I
J    K    L    M    N    O    P    Q    R
S    T    U    V    W    X    Y    Z

Chaldean method

1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8
A    B    C    D    E    U    O    F
I    K    G    M    H    V    Z    P
J    R    L    T    N    W
Q         S         X
Y


Numbers are then reduced numerologically as follows:

7+7+7+7 = 2+8 = 1+0 = 1

There is an exception with Chaldean numerology, where "repeating numbers" are left alone.

For example, 7777 would then remain the same, it would not be reduced to 1.

Further examples of Chaldean numerology are:

OZ would be 77 (not 5)
HEN would be 555 (not 6).
